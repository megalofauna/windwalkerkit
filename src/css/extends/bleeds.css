/**
 * FULL BLEED MIXIN
 * Extend this (via `@extend full-bleed`) into elements you want to have the full bleed treatment;
 * assign max-width property with Tailwind (e.g., in CSS: `@apply max-w-3xl` /
 * in markup: `max-w-3xl`) if you'd like to constrain the bleed to a maximum 
 * width. If you don't assign a max-width, the element will bleed to the 
 * left and right edges of the viewport.
