Built for tinkerers, WindWalker is a robust, well-documented [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit, forked from [@andybelldesign](https://twitter.com/andybelldesign)'s [Hylia](https://hylia.website/) project, built with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) pre-configured, so that you can one-click install a progressive, accessible blog in minutes and customize it to your liking with granular control.
